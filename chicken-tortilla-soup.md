### Instructions

1. **Sauté the Vegetables**  
   Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion, bell pepper, and jalapeño (if using). Cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and sauté for another minute.

2. **Add Spices**  
   Stir in chili powder, cumin, chipotle powder, smoked paprika, oregano, and salt. Cook for 30 seconds to toast the spices and enhance their flavors.

3. **Build the Soup Base**  
   Add the diced tomatoes (with their juices), black beans, corn, vegetable broth, and water. Stir to combine and bring the soup to a gentle boil.

4. **Blend a Portion of the Soup**  
   Use an immersion blender or carefully transfer about 1–2 cups of the soup to a blender. Blend until smooth, then return it to the pot. This step thickens the soup and gives it a creamy texture while keeping the rest chunky.

5. **Simmer**  
   Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and let the soup simmer for 15 minutes to blend the flavors.

6. **Prepare the Plant-Based Chicken**  
   While the soup is simmering, heat a small skillet over medium heat with a touch of olive oil. Cook the Alpha plant-based chicken strips for 3–5 minutes until lightly browned. Then shred or dice them as desired.

7. **Combine and Finish**  
   Add the cooked plant-based chicken to the soup. Stir in the lime juice and chopped cilantro. Simmer for another 5 minutes.

8. **Serve and Garnish**  
   Ladle the soup into bowls and top with tortilla strips, avocado, vegan cheese, sour cream, or any garnishes you like. Serve with lime wedges on the side for extra zing.
