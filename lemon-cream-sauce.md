# üçã Light Lemon Cream Linguine

## Ingredients
- 12 oz linguine (or your preferred pasta)  
- 2 tablespoons olive oil  
- 3 cloves garlic, minced  
- 1 cup light cream (or half-and-half)  
- Zest of 1 lemon  
- 3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice  
- ¬Ω cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese  
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste  
- Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)  

## Instructions

1. **Cook the Pasta**  
   Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the linguine and cook until al dente, according to package instructions. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water, then drain the pasta.

2. **Prepare the Sauce**  
   In a large skillet over medium heat, heat the olive oil. Add the minced garlic and saut√© for about 1 minute, until fragrant.

3. **Add Cream and Lemon**  
   Reduce the heat to low. Stir in the light cream, lemon zest, and lemon juice. Simmer gently for 2‚Äì3 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.

4. **Incorporate Cheese**  
   Gradually whisk in the grated Parmesan cheese until the sauce is smooth and creamy. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.

5. **Combine Pasta and Sauce**  
   Add the cooked linguine to the skillet, tossing to coat the pasta evenly with the sauce. If the sauce is too thick, gradually add some of the reserved pasta water until the desired consistency is reached.

6. **Serve**  
   Divide the pasta among serving plates. Garnish with chopped fresh parsley and additional Parmesan cheese, if desired.
