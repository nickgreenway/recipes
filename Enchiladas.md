### Instructions
#### For the Red Enchilada Sauce
1. **Cook the roux and spices.**  
   Heat olive oil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Add flour and cook for 1 minute, whisking constantly. Add chili powder, garlic powder, cumin, oregano, and chipotle powder. Cook for 1 more minute, whisking constantly.

2. **Simmer.**  
   Gradually pour in the stock, whisking constantly to combine until no lumps remain. Bring the sauce to a simmer, then reduce the heat to medium-low. Let the sauce simmer uncovered for 10–15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it has slightly thickened.

3. **Season.**  
   Taste and season with fine sea salt as needed. (Start with about 1/2 teaspoon, adjusting based on the saltiness of your stock.)

4. **Serve or Store.**  
   Use immediately in your enchilada recipe or let it cool and store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.

#### For the Enchiladas
1. **Prep oven.**  
   Preheat oven to 350°F. Ensure your enchilada sauce is ready to use.

2. **Sauté the filling mixture.**  
   Heat olive oil in a large sauté pan over medium-high heat. Add diced onion and sauté for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it begins to soften. Add Alpha plant-based chicken and green chiles, seasoning with salt and pepper. Cook for 4–5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until heated through. Sprinkle in the chipotle powder, stir to combine, and cook for an additional 1–2 minutes. Stir in the black beans until evenly mixed. Remove from heat and set aside.

3. **Assemble the enchiladas.**  
   Set up an assembly line with tortillas, enchilada sauce, filling mixture, and cheese. Lay out a tortilla, spread 2 tablespoons of sauce over its surface, add a generous spoonful of the filling mixture, and sprinkle with 1/3 cup cheese. Roll up the tortilla and place it in a greased 9x13-inch baking dish. Repeat with remaining tortillas. Spread any remaining sauce over the top and sprinkle with extra cheese.

4. **Bake.**  
   Bake uncovered for 20 minutes until the enchiladas are cooked through and the tortillas are slightly crispy. Transfer the dish to a wire rack.

5. **Serve.**  
   Serve hot, garnished with your favorite toppings. Enjoy!
