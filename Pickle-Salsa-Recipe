# ðŸ¥’ Pickle Salsa Recipe

If you love pickles, you *have* to try this tangy, zesty, and slightly spicy salsa. Inspired by @freddsters and made with @grillospickles!

## ðŸ§‚ Ingredients

- 1â€“2 tbsp olive oil  
- 8â€“10 tomatillos  
- 3 jalapeÃ±os *(use 4 if not using serrano)*  
- 1 serrano pepper *(optional)*  
- 1 onion, quartered  
- 3 cloves garlic, unpeeled  
- 1 bunch cilantro  
- Juice from Â½ lime, to taste  
- 1 (32 oz) container of @grillospickles, **drained** *(reserve the juice)*  
- Â¼â€“Â½ cup pickle juice, to taste  
- Tortilla chips, for serving  

## ðŸ”¥ Instructions

1. **Char the Veggies**  
   In a large skillet, heat 1â€“2 tbsp olive oil over medium-high heat. Once hot, add:
   - tomatillos  
   - jalapeÃ±os  
   - serrano (if using)  
   - onion  
   - unpeeled garlic cloves  
   
   Cook everything for about **10 minutes**, flipping occasionally until blistered and golden. The more color, the deeper the flavor.

2. **Cool and Blend**  
   Let the veggies cool slightly. Peel the garlic, then transfer everything to a blender.

3. **Add Fresh Ingredients**  
   Into the blender, add:
   - Juice of Â½ lime  
   - 1 bunch cilantro  
   - Drained pickles  
   - Â¼â€“Â½ cup pickle juice (to taste)  

   Pulse until your desired texture â€” smooth or chunky.

4. **Taste and Adjust**  
   Add more lime or pickle juice if needed.

5. **Serve**  
   Enjoy immediately with tortilla chips or chill for even more flavor!
