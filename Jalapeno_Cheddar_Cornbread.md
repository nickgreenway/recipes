# Jalapeño Cheddar Cornbread Recipe

## Ingredients
- **1 cup (240 ml)** buttermilk (or whole milk with 1 tbsp vinegar/lemon juice)
- **1/2 cup (115 g)** unsalted butter, melted and slightly cooled
- **2 large eggs**
- **1 cup (125 g)** yellow cornmeal
- **1 cup (125 g)** all-purpose flour
- **1/4 cup (50 g)** granulated sugar (optional, for a sweeter cornbread)
- **1 tsp** baking powder
- **1/2 tsp** baking soda
- **1/2 tsp** salt
- **1 cup (100 g)** sharp cheddar cheese, shredded
- **1–2 jalapeños**, finely diced (remove seeds for less heat)
- **1/3 cup (50 g)** canned or fresh corn kernels (optional, for texture)
- **Extra shredded cheddar and jalapeño slices for topping (optional)**

## Instructions

### For Baking in a Regular Pan:
1. **Preheat Oven:**
   - Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Grease a 9-inch square baking dish or muffin tin.

2. **Mix Wet Ingredients:**
   - In a medium bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, melted butter, and eggs until smooth.

3. **Combine Dry Ingredients:**
   - In a large bowl, whisk together the cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.

4. **Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:**
   - Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Stir until just combined (don't overmix).

5. **Add Cheddar and Jalapeños:**
   - Fold in the shredded cheddar, diced jalapeños, and corn kernels if using.

6. **Bake:**
   - Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Smooth the top with a spatula. If desired, sprinkle extra cheddar and place jalapeño slices on top for garnish.
   - Bake for 20–25 minutes (or 15–20 minutes for muffins), or until the top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.

7. **Cool and Serve:**
   - Let the cornbread cool for 5–10 minutes before slicing. Serve warm with butter or alongside chili.

### For Baking in a Cast-Iron Skillet:
1. **Preheat the Skillet:**
   - Place your cast-iron skillet (8 or 9-inch) in the oven while it's preheating to 375°F (190°C). This helps create a crispy crust.

2. **Grease the Skillet:**
   - Once the skillet is hot, carefully remove it from the oven. Add 1–2 tablespoons of butter or a drizzle of oil to the skillet, swirling to coat evenly.

3. **Add Batter:**
   - Pour the prepared batter into the hot skillet. The batter will sizzle, forming a crispy crust.

4. **Bake:**
   - Return the skillet to the oven and bake for 20–25 minutes, or until golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.

5. **Cool and Serve:**
   - Let the cornbread cool for 5–10 minutes before slicing.

## Make-Ahead Tips
- **Dry Ingredients:** Mix the dry ingredients and store in an airtight container for up to 1 day.
- **Wet Ingredients:** Combine wet ingredients and refrigerate until ready to bake.
- **Add-Ins:** Prep jalapeños, cheese, and other mix-ins ahead of time.

**Important:** If preparing the batter ahead of time, only mix wet and dry ingredients right before baking to preserve the leavening effect.

If you must prepare the batter in advance, refrigerate it for up to 1–2 hours and add 1/2 tsp extra baking powder before baking.

## Notes
- For extra moisture, add 1–2 tablespoons of sour cream to the batter.
- To enhance the smoky flavor, use smoked cheddar or a pinch of smoked paprika.
- Adjust the number of jalapeños to control the heat level.

Enjoy your crispy, cheesy **Jalapeño Cheddar Cornbread**!
